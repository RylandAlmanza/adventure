Tutorial
--------
You start out on the map. Try walking into a tree (represented by a T) using
your movement keys. You cut down a tree! If you look to the right, you'll see
"log" appear in your inventory. You got the log from the tree. You should also
have a tinder box that you started with.

Let's make a fire. First press your drop key. A little arrow will appear in your
inventory pane. Use the movement keys to move up and down through your
inventory. When you've got the arrow over "log" press your select key to choose
it and drop it. Now, move to a tile adjacent to the log you just dropped. Press
your apply key, and select "tinder box" from your inventory. It will then ask
you which direction you want to apply the tinder box to. You'll want to press
the movement key that points to the log you dropped. Whoo, fire!

Let's catch a fish. First, move next to a water tile (represented by a ~). You
can press the period key on your keyboard to wait. keep waiting until the water
tile you're standing next to is a brighter blue. brighter blue means there's a
fish there. Try to walk into the brighter blue water tile, and you'll catch a
fish!
